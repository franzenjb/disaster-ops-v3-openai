## 🏭 Test Data Factories

### Purpose
Generate realistic, consistent test data that matches real disaster response scenarios.

### Available Factories
- `operationFactory`: Creates emergency operations, training exercises
- `facilityFactory`: Generates shelters, feeding sites, EOCs
- `personnelFactory`: Creates incident commanders, staff, volunteers
- `dailyScheduleFactory`: Builds operational schedules
- `workAssignmentFactory`: Creates task assignments
- `gapFactory`: Generates resource gaps and requests
- `scenarioFactory`: Complete disaster response scenarios

### Usage Example
```typescript
import { scenarioFactory } from '@/__tests__/factories';

// Generate complete hurricane response scenario
const scenario = scenarioFactory.buildHurricaneResponse();

// Generate large dataset for stress testing
const stressData = bulkDataFactory.generateStressTestDataset('stress-test-op');
```

## 🛠️ Test Utilities

### Test Helpers (`test-helpers.ts`)
- Database setup/cleanup functions
- Data synchronization wait utilities
- Performance measurement tools
- Mock service generators
- Error simulation utilities

### Key Functions
```typescript
// Database management
await setupTestDatabase();
await seedTestDatabase('test-operation-id');
await cleanupTestDatabase();

// Performance testing
const result = await measureExecutionTime(
  async () => await service.updateFacility(facility),
  'Facility update operation'
);

// Data verification
await waitForDataSync();
await verifyDataPropagation(service, 'facilities', expectedData, 5);
```

   npm run test:critical     # Run only critical tests
   ```

### Writing New Tests

1. **Follow Naming Convention**: `*.test.ts` for unit/integration, `*.spec.ts` for E2E
2. **Use Factories**: Generate test data with provided factories
3. **Mark Critical Tests**: Add `CRITICAL` in test descriptions for deployment blockers
4. **Include Performance Assertions**: Validate timing requirements
5. **Test Error Conditions**: Include error handling scenarios
