# DISASTER-OPS-V3 COMPLETE SALVAGE PLAN
## Multi-Agent Analysis and Recovery Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** September 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution  
**Estimated Duration:** 16 weeks  
**Estimated Budget:** $548,400

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The disaster-ops-v3 project represents a **perfect storm of architectural over-engineering, absent project management, and complete quality control failure.** This document provides a comprehensive salvage strategy developed by 6 specialist agents to **preserve the valuable UI investment while replacing the problematic backend** with modern, reliable technology.

### Current State Assessment
- **0% test coverage** due to broken infrastructure
- **4 duplicate facility managers** causing maintenance chaos
- **Sophisticated event sourcing architecture** that doesn't work reliably
- **Critical security vulnerabilities** including hardcoded API keys
- **Missing basic functionality** (address autocomplete, phone links)
- **Database connection errors** due to intentionally disabled remote sync

### Salvage Strategy
**PRESERVE:** Excellent React UI components with Red Cross IAP domain knowledge  
**REPLACE:** Event sourcing backend with simple, reliable Supabase architecture  
**ADD:** Missing features (Google Places, phone links, authentication)  
**FIX:** Security, performance, and testing infrastructure  

---

## PHASE 1: EMERGENCY FOUNDATION SETUP (Weeks 1-4)

### Week 1: Critical Infrastructure
**Database Team Priority Actions:**
1. **Supabase Project Setup**
   - Create new Supabase project with PostgreSQL foundation
   - Configure authentication with email/password + MFA
   - Set up development, staging, and production environments

2. **Emergency Security Fix**
   - Remove hardcoded Google Maps API key: `AIzaSyA0ywYLRnxM-R8v_RFbWtCrx0q5dJ_RyMk`
   - Move to environment variables immediately
   - Audit all other potential API key exposures

3. **Testing Infrastructure Repair**
   - Fix broken Jest/TypeScript configuration
   - Resolve module import/export issues
   - Get basic test suites executing (currently 0% coverage)

### Week 2: Database Schema Design
**Core Tables Creation:**
```sql
-- Operations table
CREATE TABLE operations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text NOT NULL,
  disaster_type text NOT NULL,
  activation_level text NOT NULL,
  status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Facilities table (replaces complex event sourcing)
CREATE TABLE facilities (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  operation_id uuid REFERENCES operations(id),
  name text NOT NULL,
  type text NOT NULL,
  address text,
  coordinates point,
  status text DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Personnel assignments
CREATE TABLE personnel_assignments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  facility_id uuid REFERENCES facilities(id),
  person_name text NOT NULL,
  role text NOT NULL,
  contact_info jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- IAP documents (simplified from complex projections)
CREATE TABLE iap_documents (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  operation_id uuid REFERENCES operations(id),
  version integer DEFAULT 1,
  content jsonb NOT NULL,
  published_at timestamptz,
  created_by uuid,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Week 3: Authentication & Authorization
**Role-Based Security Implementation:**
```sql
-- Row Level Security policies
ALTER TABLE facilities ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- I&P Group: Full access
CREATE POLICY "iap_group_full_access" ON facilities
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'ip_group'
);

-- Discipline Teams: Access to assigned facilities only
CREATE POLICY "discipline_team_access" ON facilities
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'discipline' AND
  id IN (
    SELECT facility_id FROM personnel_assignments 
    WHERE person_name = auth.jwt() ->> 'name'
  )
);

-- Field Teams: Read-only access to assigned facilities
CREATE POLICY "field_team_readonly" ON facilities
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'field' AND
  id IN (
    SELECT facility_id FROM personnel_assignments 
    WHERE person_name = auth.jwt() ->> 'name'
  )
);
```

### Week 4: Basic Data Migration
**Preserve Existing Data:**
- Export current IndexedDB data to JSON format
- Transform complex event-sourced data to simple relational structure
- Import into Supabase with data validation
- Create adapter layer for UI compatibility

---

## PHASE 2: PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT (Weeks 5-8)

### UI Component Consolidation
**Priority Consolidations:**

1. **Facility Managers (4 → 1)**
   ```typescript
   // Merge capabilities from:
   // - RealFacilityManager (database integration)
   // - FacilityManager (basic UI)
   // - EnhancedFacilityManager (improved layout)
   // - FacilityManagerFixed (bug fixes)
   
   export function UnifiedFacilityManager() {
     // Combined best features from all 4 versions
     // + Google Places address autocomplete
     // + Clickable phone numbers
     // + Role-based access control
   }
   ```

2. **Map Components (8 → 1)**
   ```typescript
   export function UnifiedMapComponent({ provider = 'osm' }) {
     // Support OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, ArcGIS
     // Dynamic provider switching with fallbacks
     // Unified interface for all map operations
   }
   ```

### Security Implementation
**Authentication Integration:**
```typescript
// Supabase Auth hooks
export function useAuth() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [role, setRole] = useState(null);
  
  // Role-based component rendering
  const hasPermission = (requiredRole: string) => {
    return ROLE_HIERARCHY[role] >= ROLE_HIERARCHY[requiredRole];
  };
  
  return { user, role, hasPermission };
}
```

### Performance Optimization
**Query Optimization:**
```typescript
// Replace event sourcing with optimized queries
export async function getFacilities(operationId: string) {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('facilities')
    .select(`
      *,
      personnel_assignments(*)
    `)
    .eq('operation_id', operationId)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
    
  return data; // <100ms target with proper indexing
}
```

---

## PHASE 3: FEATURE COMPLETION (Weeks 9-12)

### Missing Features Implementation

1. **Google Places Address Autocomplete**
   ```typescript
   export function AddressAutocomplete({ onSelect }: Props) {
     const [predictions, setPredictions] = useState([]);
     
     // Server-side API calls via Supabase Edge Functions
     const searchPlaces = async (input: string) => {
       const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('places-search', {
         body: { input }
       });
       setPredictions(data.predictions);
     };
   }
   ```

2. **Clickable Phone Numbers**
   ```typescript
   export function PhoneNumber({ number }: Props) {
     return (
       <a 
         href={`tel:${number}`}
         className="text-blue-600 hover:underline"
       >
         {formatPhoneNumber(number)}
       </a>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   ```typescript
   // Supabase real-time subscriptions
   useEffect(() => {
     const subscription = supabase
       .channel('facilities')
       .on('postgres_changes', 
         { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'facilities' },
         handleFacilityUpdate
       )
       .subscribe();
       
     return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
   }, []);
   ```

### Testing Infrastructure
**Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
```typescript
// Integration tests with Supabase
describe('UnifiedFacilityManager', () => {
  test('creates facility with address autocomplete', async () => {
    // Test Google Places integration
    // Test Supabase data persistence
    // Test real-time updates
  });
  
  test('enforces role-based access', async () => {
    // Test I&P Group full access
    // Test Discipline Team restricted access
    // Test Field Team read-only access
  });
});
```
