## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Analysis

### Current Implementation

The system defines a hierarchical role structure in `/src/types/index.ts`:

```typescript
export type UserRole = 
  | 'viewer'
  | 'operator' 
  | 'section_chief'
  | 'incident_commander'
  | 'admin';

export type IAPRole = 
  | 'ip_group'      // I&P Group - full IAP editing access
  | 'discipline'    // Discipline Teams - facility-specific access
  | 'field'         // Field Teams - read-only access
  | 'viewer';       // View-only access
```

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

#### 1.1 No Authentication System Implementation
- **Issue**: The codebase contains comprehensive role definitions but lacks any actual authentication or session management implementation
- **Impact**: Anyone can access the system without credentials, potentially compromising disaster operations
- **Evidence**: No login components, session management, or authentication middleware found
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Complete security bypass

#### 1.2 Client-Side Role Enforcement Only
- **Issue**: Role-based permissions exist only in TypeScript interfaces with no server-side enforcement
- **Impact**: Roles can be bypassed by modifying client-side code or API requests
- **Evidence**: `Permission` interface in types but no enforcement mechanisms in database or API layers
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Authorization bypass

### ðŸŸ  HIGH RISK ISSUES

#### 1.3 Overly Permissive Database Policies
- **Location**: `/supabase/schema/30_rls.sql`
- **Issue**: RLS policies allow all authenticated users access to all data
```sql
create policy events_read on event_store.events for select to authenticated using (true);
create policy ops_read on ops.operations for select to authenticated using (true);
```
- **Impact**: No tenant isolation or operation-specific access control
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Data exposure across operations

#### 1.4 Missing IAP Role Access Control
- **Issue**: Complex IAP role system (ip_group, discipline, field, viewer) has no enforcement mechanism
- **Impact**: Field teams could access sensitive planning information; unauthorized IAP modifications
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Mission-critical data exposure

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Authentication System**
   - Add Supabase Auth or similar authentication provider
   - Implement proper session management with secure tokens
   - Add login/logout flows with multi-factor authentication for incident commanders

2. **Enforce Server-Side Authorization**
   - Implement RLS policies based on operation membership and role hierarchy
   - Add middleware to validate permissions for all API endpoints
   - Create operation-scoped access controls

3. **IAP Access Control**
   - Implement granular permissions for IAP sections based on role
   - Add approval workflows for critical IAP updates
   - Implement read-only enforcement for field team access

## 2. Data Security Analysis

### Local Storage Implementation

The system uses a dual-database architecture with extensive client-side storage:

1. **IndexedDB** (via Dexie) - `/src/lib/store/LocalStore.ts`
2. **localStorage** - `/src/lib/simple-store.ts`
3. **sessionStorage** - Session and device ID storage

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES

#### 2.1 Unencrypted Sensitive Data Storage
- **Issue**: All disaster operations data stored in plain text in IndexedDB and localStorage
- **Impact**: Sensitive operational information accessible to any malicious script or browser extension
- **Evidence**: 
```typescript
// DatabaseManager.ts - No encryption layer
await this.temporaryDb.execute(collection, operation, data);

// simple-store.ts - Plain text localStorage
localStorage.setItem(this.storageKey, JSON.stringify(data));
```
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Sensitive operational data exposure

#### 2.2 No Data Classification or Sanitization
- **Issue**: PII, operational secrets, and facility locations stored without classification
- **Impact**: Privacy violations and operational security breaches
- **Evidence**: Personnel data, facility addresses, and contact information stored in plain text
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Privacy and operational security violations

#### 2.3 Weak Event Integrity
- **Issue**: Event hashing uses basic Base64 encoding instead of cryptographic hashing
```typescript
// events/types.ts
return btoa(canonical).substring(0, 32); // Not cryptographically secure
```
- **Impact**: Event tampering possible, audit trail compromise
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Data integrity compromise

### ðŸŸ  HIGH RISK ISSUES

#### 2.4 Device and Session ID Security
- **Issue**: Device IDs and session IDs use weak UUID generation and persistent storage
- **Impact**: Session hijacking, device tracking, replay attacks
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Session security compromise

#### 2.5 Missing Data Retention Controls
- **Issue**: No automatic PII redaction, data retention policies, or secure deletion
- **Impact**: Compliance violations, data accumulation risks
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Compliance and privacy violations

### Recommendations

1. **implement Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt all local storage data using Web Crypto API
   - Implement per-operation encryption keys derived from user credentials
   - Add client-side encryption for event payloads containing sensitive data

2. **Data Classification System**
   - Classify data as Public, Sensitive, Confidential, or Restricted
   - Implement automatic PII detection and masking
   - Add data retention policies with automated cleanup

3. **Enhance Event Integrity**
   - Use SHA-256 for event hashing with proper salt
   - Implement hash chains for tamper detection
   - Add digital signatures for critical events

- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to disaster operations systems
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Complete security bypass

#### 3.2 Weak Session Management
- **Issue**: Session IDs stored in sessionStorage without encryption or validation
```typescript
function getSessionId(): string {
  let sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem('disaster_ops_session_id');
  if (!sessionId) {
    sessionId = generateUUID();
    sessionStorage.setItem('disaster_ops_session_id', sessionId);
  }
  return sessionId;
}
```
- **Impact**: Session fixation, XSS session theft
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Session security compromise

### ðŸŸ  HIGH RISK ISSUES  

#### 3.3 Missing Multi-Factor Authentication
- **Issue**: No MFA implementation for high-privilege roles (Incident Commander, Admin)
- **Impact**: Account takeover of critical disaster response positions
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Privileged account compromise

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Comprehensive Authentication**
   - Deploy Supabase Auth with email/password and social providers
   - Add MFA for incident commanders and section chiefs
   - Implement proper session timeout and renewal

2. **Secure Session Management**
   - Use secure, HTTP-only cookies for session tokens
   - Implement session validation and rotation
   - Add proper logout functionality with session cleanup

async processQuery(query: AIQuery): Promise<AIResponse>
```
- **Impact**: Injection attacks, API abuse, data exfiltration
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Data injection and abuse

#### 4.4 Insufficient Error Handling
- **Issue**: API errors expose system information and internal state
- **Impact**: Information disclosure, system reconnaissance
- **Risk Level**: HIGH - Information disclosure

### Recommendations

1. **Secure API Key Management**
   - Use HashiCorp Vault or similar for API key storage

## Conclusion

The Disaster Operations v3 platform, while architecturally sophisticated, has significant security vulnerabilities that pose critical risks to disaster response operations. The absence of authentication, unencrypted sensitive data storage, and lack of API security controls create an environment where operational data could be compromised, potentially impacting emergency response effectiveness.

**Immediate action is required** to implement basic authentication and data encryption before this system can be safely used in disaster response scenarios. The recommended phased approach prioritizes critical security implementations while maintaining system functionality for emergency operations.

The unique requirements of disaster operationsâ€”including offline functionality, field deployment, and life-safety implicationsâ€”make security implementation both more challenging and more critical than typical business applications.
