    await api.saveWorksheet(worksheet);
  };

  return (
    <ICS215WorksheetMain
      operationId="your-operation-id"
      onSave={handleSave}
      readonly={false}
      printMode={false}
    />
  );
}
```

### With Initial Data

```tsx
import { ICS215WorksheetMain, ICS215Worksheet } from './components/ics215';

const initialWorksheet: Partial<ICS215Worksheet> = {
  incidentName: "Hurricane Response",
  operationalPeriodStart: new Date(),
  operationalPeriodEnd: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  preparedBy: "Operations Section Chief",
  sectionType: "Operations"
};

function MyApp() {
  return (
