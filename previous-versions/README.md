# Previous Versions Archive

This directory contains the earlier versions of the Disaster Operations Platform for reference and to preserve lessons learned about interface design and architecture evolution.

## Version History

### v1-v2-combined/
This folder contains the combined work from versions 1 and 2, which includes:

**Version 1 (Original):**
- Initial single-file DatabaseManager (547 lines)
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple state management
- ICS forms implementation
- Initial UI with tabs for different service lines

**Version 2 (Enhanced):**
- Attempted modularization
- Added TypeScript support
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced UI components
- Better separation of concerns

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Architecture Evolution**
   - V1: Monolithic database manager → V2: Attempted modularity → V3: Event sourcing
   - V1-V2: Direct state manipulation → V3: Event-driven with projections

2. **Database Design**
   - V1-V2: Single local database → V3: Dual database (local + remote)
   - V1-V2: CRUD operations → V3: Event log as single source of truth

3. **Offline Capability**
   - V1-V2: Basic localStorage → V3: IndexedDB with Dexie + sync engine
   - V1-V2: Manual conflict resolution → V3: CRDT strategies

4. **UI/UX Insights**
   - Tab-based interface for service lines (feeding, sheltering, etc.)
   - Form 5266 digital transformation requirements
   - ICS forms (202-215) implementation patterns
   - Geographic selection needs

5. **Data Model Evolution**
   - Line number references (Line 9: Meals Served, Line 26: EOCs, etc.)
   - Service metrics tracking
   - Roster management requirements
   - IAP document structure

## Important Files to Reference

From v1-v2-combined:
- `/src/lib/database.js` - Original DatabaseManager implementation
- `/src/components/` - UI components and patterns
- ICS form implementations
- Service line tab implementations

## Migration to V3

Version 3 represents a complete architectural rebuild based on lessons from V1 and V2:
- Event sourcing for complete audit trail
- Proper offline-first design
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Clean separation of concerns
- TypeScript throughout
- Modern React patterns (React 19)
- Next.js 15 for better performance
