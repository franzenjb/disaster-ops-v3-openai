# Tomorrow's Strategic Discussion Agenda
## Comprehensive Project Review Before Development Continues

---

**Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** In-depth strategic discussion before coding continues  
**Goal:** Align on complete vision, architecture, and implementation approach  

---

## üìã **DISCUSSION AGENDA**

### **1. PROJECT SCOPE & VISION ALIGNMENT** (30 minutes)
- **Complete requirements review** - What exactly are we building?
- **Success criteria definition** - How do we know when we're done?
- **User experience goals** - What should the day-to-day workflow feel like?
- **Integration requirements** - How does this fit with existing Red Cross systems?

### **2. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE** (45 minutes)
- **Database design decisions** - Simple vs complex schema
- **Multi-user strategy** - How to handle "many, many people editing"
- **Offline/online architecture** - Field operations requirements
- **Deployment approach** - Where and how will this run?
- **Performance requirements** - Speed, reliability, scalability needs

### **3. FEATURE PRIORITIZATION** (30 minutes)
- **Must-have vs nice-to-have** - What's truly critical for MVP?
- **Development sequence** - Which components to build first?
- **Integration points** - What connects to what and when?
- **Testing strategy** - How to validate with real operations?

### **4. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY** (30 minutes)
- **Technology stack decisions** - Final choices on frameworks/tools
- **Development methodology** - How to build systematically
- **Quality standards** - What level of polish is required?
- **Timeline and milestones** - Realistic delivery expectations

### **5. OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS** (30 minutes)
- **Change management** - How to transition from Excel
- **Training requirements** - What do users need to learn?
- **Support and maintenance** - Who maintains this long-term?
- **Risk mitigation** - What could go wrong and how to prevent it?

## üîç **KEY QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE**

### **Technical Decisions:**
- **Database approach**: Simple (LocalStorage) vs Robust (PostgreSQL) vs Hybrid?
- **User interface**: Web-based vs Desktop app vs Mobile-first?
- **Real-time updates**: How to handle simultaneous editing conflicts?
- **IAP generation**: HTML/CSS vs PDF generation vs Word integration?

### **Operational Decisions:**
- **Access model**: Honor system vs Role-based vs Hybrid approach?
- **Workflow integration**: How does this fit current I&P processes?
- **Data migration**: How to transition from existing Excel worksheets?
- **Backup and recovery**: How to ensure data never gets lost?

### **Strategic Decisions:**
- **Pilot approach**: Start with one DRO or full rollout?
- **Feature scope**: Core IAP only vs comprehensive planning system?
- **Integration timeline**: Standalone first vs immediate system integration?
- **Success metrics**: How to measure adoption and effectiveness?

## üìä **MATERIALS TO REVIEW**

### **Current Foundation:**
- ‚úÖ **Working prototypes** - Facility planning, Director's message editor
- ‚úÖ **Technical architecture** - Page system with headers/footers
- ‚úÖ **Operational understanding** - Jeff's developer message
- ‚úÖ **Approach analysis** - Comparison of different technical strategies

### **Reference Documents:**
- **Real IAP examples** - 53-page FLOCOM IAP structure
- **Excel worksheets** - Current operational planning process
- **GAP organizational charts** - Standard position/role definitions
- **Red Cross IT standards** - Deployment and security requirements

---

## üéØ **DISCUSSION OUTCOMES NEEDED**

### **Clear Decisions On:**
1. **Final technical architecture** - Database, frontend, deployment
2. **Development priorities** - Which 5-10 features to build first
3. **Quality standards** - How close to existing IAP is "close enough"
4. **Timeline expectations** - Realistic milestones and delivery dates
5. **Success criteria** - Specific, measurable goals for MVP

### **Documented Agreements:**
- **Technical specification** - Detailed system design
- **Feature requirements** - Complete user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Development roadmap** - Sprint planning and milestone schedule
- **Risk assessment** - Potential issues and mitigation strategies

---

## üí° **PRE-DISCUSSION PREPARATION**

### **Questions for Jeff to Consider:**
1. **What's the biggest risk** to this project's success?
2. **Which existing Red Cross systems** must this integrate with?
3. **How do we measure** if this is better than Excel?
4. **What would cause users** to reject this system?
5. **How do we handle** the transition period from Excel to new system?

### **Technical Questions:**
1. **Where should this be deployed** (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)?
2. **How many concurrent users** in a typical large DRO?
3. **What's the internet connectivity** situation in field operations?
4. **Are there Red Cross IT policies** that constrain our choices?
5. **What's the approval process** for new systems?

## üöÄ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

### **After Tomorrow's Discussion:**
- ‚úÖ **Complete technical specification** ready for development
- ‚úÖ **Clear feature prioritization** with realistic timeline
- ‚úÖ **Validated approach** that solves real operational problems
- ‚úÖ **Risk mitigation plan** for smooth deployment
- ‚úÖ **Success metrics** to track progress and adoption

### **Ready to Build:**
- **Systematic development** with clear requirements
- **Focused effort** on highest-value features
- **Confident architecture** that scales to real operations
- **Quality standards** that ensure user adoption
